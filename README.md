# NetView

## Intention of this project is to create a networking tool for daily use.  Some of the features of this tool are listed below

1. Copy switch config from file and load it via serial to the connected switch
    - Must validate config on uploaded switch to the original
    - Must identify my available serial devices and give me the option to easy choose one (MACOS)
    - Must ask for credentials and not store them
2. Load a list of device IP addresses, ping them, save the results, then ping once again to see if the results match. 
This will identify device connectivity after network migration


3. (maybe?)Scan current subnet, provide me with a prioritized list of devices (networking vendors appear higher on the list to help find rogue devices)
    - See if it's possible to obtain the IP addresses of the devices on the subnet
